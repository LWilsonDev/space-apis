Live Preview [here](https://space-apis.herokuapp.com/)

NASA have provided some fantastic resources for developers. I have built this website to explore a few of their API's.

### Features
- Landing page with interactive space-themed background using [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/#default) by Vincent Garreau 
- Visitors can view NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)
- Read the information provided by NASA about each APOD
- Search through over 20 years of APOD's
- JQuery Date picker
- Find out how many people are on the International Space Station (ISS) right now, and who they are
- See where the ISS is passing over on Earth right now on Google Maps 
- Update the location to see how far the ISS has travelled

### Technologies used
* Python
* Django
* Javascript/JQuery
* AJAX -  I have incorporated AJAX requests to get the ISS location data. Users can click a button to update the location.
* Google Maps API - Users can see the location of the ISS on a google map.
* [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/#default)
* AWS S3 for serving static files


### Features yet to implement

- An exploration of the fascinating Mars Rover photographs provided by NASA through their API's
