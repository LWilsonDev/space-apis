# Space API's
## Project exploring NASA's API's

Live Preview [here](https://space-apis.herokuapp.com/)

This is built using Django. I am thinking about extending it at some point to include other pages, and explore more of NASA's fantastic API resources.
Currently you can find out how many people are in space right now, and track the movements of the International Space Station.

### Technologies used
* Python
* Django
* Javascript/JQuery
* AJAX -  I have incorporated AJAX requests to get the ISS location data. Users can click a button to update the location.
* Google Maps API - Users can see the location of the ISS on a google map.

### Bugs and issues

* Google Map not displaying on mobile (Safari). I have tried many bug fixes, but no joy... I think the issue is around the AJAX request. Work in progress!!
